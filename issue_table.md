| **Issue**                                      | **Type / Tool**                 | **Line(s)** | **Description**                                                                       | **Fix Approach**                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutable default argument (`logs=[]`)           | **Bug (Pylint)**                | ~12         | Lists are mutable and reused across function calls, leading to incorrect shared data. | Changed to `logs=None` and initialized inside the function.                                              |
| Bare `except:` without specifying error type   | **Bug (Pylint / Bandit)**       | ~26         | Catching all exceptions hides real errors and makes debugging harder.                 | Replaced with `except KeyError:` to catch specific errors only.                                          |
| Use of `eval()` function                       | **Security Issue (Bandit)**     | ~72         | Dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code.                                      | Removed `eval()` completely and replaced with a safe print statement.                                    |
| No newline at end of file                      | **Style Issue (Flake8 W292)**   | End of file | File didn’t end with a newline character (PEP8 violation).                            | Added exactly one newline at end of file.                                                                |
| Too many blank lines (E303)                    | **Style Issue (Flake8)**        | ~125–130    | More than two blank lines between functions.                                          | Reduced to at most one blank line between functions.                                                     |
| Blank line contains whitespace (W293)          | **Style Issue (Flake8)**        | ~128        | Blank line had extra space characters.                                                | Removed trailing spaces.                                                                                 |
| Missing exception handling for file operations | **Quality / Security (Bandit)** | ~39–50      | File operations could fail without handling errors.                                   | Used `with open(..., encoding="utf-8")` to safely manage files.                                          |
| Unvalidated input types                        | **Logic Issue (Pylint)**        | ~18–22      | Function accepted invalid data types (like `add_item(123, "ten")`).                   | Added `isinstance()` checks for `item` and `qty`.                                                        |
| Global variable usage warning                  | **Info (Pylint)**               | ~44         | Use of `global stock_data` flagged as bad practice.                                   | Justified use since it’s necessary for shared state; added comment `# pylint: disable=global-statement`. |
